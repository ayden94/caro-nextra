# Introduce the caro-kann

Caro-Kann is a global state management tool internally built with the useSyncExternalStore hook. It supports TypeScript and is compatible with both Next.js and React.js. With a syntax similar to useState, Caro-Kann is intuitive for developers familiar with React.js.

##  what's new in caro-kann@3.1.0

* The new version of Caro-Kann introduces a variety of middleware options. Middleware such as logger, validate, and debounce enable more flexible state management.
* The zustand middleware is now deprecated. It can no longer be used for middleware composition and is no longer maintained. However, backward compatibility is still preserved.
* The migrate logic in the persist middleware has been updated. With the new migrate pipe, versioned persistence can now be handled more reliably and effectively.

## Installation

Caro-Kann is available as a package on NPM for use:

```bash
npm i caro-kann@latest
pnpm add caro-kann@latest
yarn add caro-kann@latest
bun add caro-kann@latest
```
